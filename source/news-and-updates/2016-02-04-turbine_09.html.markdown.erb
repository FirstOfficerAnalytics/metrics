FirstOfficer had a performance upgrade. The updates are now running in half the time they used to take before. I hope you keep on reporting any performance issues.

This improvement was important also because I was worried Iâ€™d have to stop taking new customers to ensure the service quality for the present customers. Now there is no urgent need for that.
