"MRR Waiting For Renewal" view now shows also the End-of-Term Subscription MRR and count.

Knowing how many subscriptions are up for renewal in each month is important information for cash-flow planning purposes. FirstOfficer already shows the summary of this information in Metrics view. However, if you have 3-month or 6-month plans, the annual and monthly summaries in Metrics view are not enough.

To access Waiting For Renewal view, go to the MRR view and click the numbers in the "Waiting for Renewal column" in the main data table. When you are in Waiting for Renewal view, use the green arrows in upper left corner to move between months.
