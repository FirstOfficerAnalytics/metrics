Do you have an ID from a 3rd party system or some other identifying information youâ€™d like to see when you view customers in FirstOfficer?

You can now add that to Stripe metadata and FirstOfficer will show it to you. You can read more and activate the feature [here](https://www.firstofficer.io/activate_ext_id) or access it from your account page.
