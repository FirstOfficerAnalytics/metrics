title: Support for quantities in non-Stripe invoices

This change only affects invoices imported manually or through the API. It does not affect invoices in Stripe.

**Problem:** It has not been possible to add seats/quantities to existing subscription when importing non-Stripe invoices.
   
**Solution:** If 'subscription ID' is filled, FirstOfficer will add quantities into the subscription referenced instead of creating a new subscription.
