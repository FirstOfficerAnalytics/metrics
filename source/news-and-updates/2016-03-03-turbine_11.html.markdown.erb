You can now view the 2016 month-to-month comparison report in FirstOfficer. I also added a handy link to the upper right corner where you can view the older reports.

View your [2016 January-February report here](https://www.firstofficer.io/annual_report?year=2016)

Thereâ€™s also a change in weekly email report. The 30-day revenue used to show only subscription revenue. From now on it will also include single purchases (non-subscription revenue).
