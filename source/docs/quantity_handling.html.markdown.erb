# Booking of Capacity-Based Charges

This article explains the principles that
FirstOfficer.io uses in booking upgrades and downgrades when Stripe quantities are used.

At 18th Nov 2014, FirstOfficer.io books the quantities
but they are only shown in [Upgrades & Downgrades View](https://www.firstofficer.io/upgrades)
