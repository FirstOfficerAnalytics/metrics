# Dashboard Customization

When it comes to dashboards one-size does not fit all.

There are several options to customize your FirstOfficer.io dashboard.
Many of the options are built-in and FirstOfficer.io automatically
detects your SaaS business model.

Options in this article need to be activated separately -
please <%= partial 'contact-support' %> for getting them.

## Change the weekly reporting day

Everyone's week does not start on Sunday.
If you have a strong weekly schedule and e.g. publish new
marketing campaign every Wednesday, of course you want your weekly email
reports and MRR Growth charts on Wednesdays.

You can have your week split at any weekday.

## Merge plans with the same name and subscription length

So you like experimenting with price - that's great. As long
as the plan name and subscription length stays the same, FirstOfficer.io can merge the plans.

No more missing metrics just because there are too few people in a plan!

## See your multi-currency dashboard in USD

Is your bank account in EUR or GBP, but you only sell in USD?

Have your dashboard converted to USD. FirstOfficer.io does report the
effect of changing currency exhange rates, but why
not eliminate that hassle altogether.
