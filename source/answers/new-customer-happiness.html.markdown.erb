# Did I get good customers?
The problem in comparing marketing campaigns
Calculating the effectiveness of non-SaaS marketing campaign is straightforward:

More sales = better campaign.

But with SaaS that first sale is just the beginning. The true value of the new customers is in how long they will stay.

So when you evaluate how good your marketing campaign is, it boils down to two things:

Did you get more customers/monthly recurring revenue?
Did you attract the right type of people, the ones who are going to stay?
What’s the best way to see if you attracted the right customers?
Many entrepreneurs use customer life-time value (CLTV) to evaluate their marketing campaigns, but I see a slight problem there. CLTV is based on the average behavior of all your old customers. It’s ok for some purposes, but it tells nothing about these new customers in particular.

To find out how these new customers behave, you’ll need to pick them apart and study them as a separate group. That’s what cohort charts do.

Non-ideal customers don’t get value from your product. They struggle to use your product and call for support more often than your ideal customers. And as they can’t get value, they usually unsubscribe in a month or two. So you lose both in acquisition costs and in support costs.

You can track this behavior with cohort retention charts - and change your marketing so that you attract more ideal customers.

But if you have seen the normal cohort tables and charts, you know how intimidating beasts they can be. How are you supposed to read a chart with 75 lines? That’s something I wanted to change.

Meet a cohort chart that doesn’t look like a roadkill
FirstOfficer.io does show the classical cohort retention chart too, but this one is easier to read. It trends the number of new customers in a cohort, and shows how much MRR is retained as time goes by.

Just click the 6-month and 12-month labels above the chart to hide them and you’ve got yourself a marketing improvement tool:

If you hover over the chart, you can see the actual values:

Unfortunately FirstOfficer.io has only Stripe integration at the moment - I don’t have access to user events or UTM tags. So I can show this data only on monthly level, not campaign by campaign.

“So how do I use this chart?”
Here are the things to check out:
How to read cohort trend chart
It’s important to check the range. The best SaaS companies may retain 95-98% of their MRR in 12 months.

Optimally both the customer count and the retention should go up - that’s how you know you are making progress and attracting more ideal customers.

It’s worth to notice that this same chart can be used to follow-up improvements in your onboarding process or in your landing page conversions. So if you change several things at the same time you’ll have troubles finding out which one actually caused the improvement.

The tooltips help you find out how much money you actually retained. You’ll also want to check the actual number of new customers. A good, reliable cohort needs to have at least 100 customers in it.
