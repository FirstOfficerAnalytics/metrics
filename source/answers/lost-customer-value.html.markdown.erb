# Am I losing high-value or low-value customers?

<%= link_to 'MRR Churn Rate', '/saas-metrics/mrr-churn-rate.html' %>
 answers this question.

If the MRR Churn Rate is bigger than
<%= link_to 'Customer Churn Rate', '/saas-metrics/customer-churn-rate.html' %>
,
you are losing more high-value customers.

When you are reading the charts, losing high-value customers looks like this (June 2014):
<%= image_tag 'qa_lost_high_value_customers.png' %>

When the green line for MRR Churn is clearly above the Subscription/Customer Churn (blue line),
you are losing high-value customers.

If the MRR Churn Rate is smaller than Customer Churn Rate,
you are losing more low-value customers.

## Detailed information

<%= link_to 'Lost MRR View', 'https://www.firstofficer.io/events/lost?type=60' %>
shows the MRR and Total Contract Value (TCV)
 for lost customers:

 As these customers are lost, the TCV shown here is also the real Customer Life-Time Value.
