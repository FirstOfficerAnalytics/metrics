# Are my new customers happier than the old ones?



1. How long your current & new customers will stay, on average?
2. How long your customers have really stayed?

## 1. I want to estimate the future

<%= link_to 'Customer Churn Rate', '/saas-metrics/customer-churn-rate.html' %>
 answers this question.

Just invert it…

<code> (1/churn rate) * 100% </code>

…and you’ll get the average customer life-time, showing how many months an average customer stays.

I’ve calculated some of the customer life-times for you:

<%= image_tag 'churn_rate_to_lifetime.png' %><br>
￼
If your customer churn rate is 15%, an average customer stays for 7 months.

This is also the turnaround time for your customer base. If your customer churn rate is 15%,
all the customers you have now
will be gone in 7 months - and you’ll need new customers to replace them.

## 2. I want to see the real current values
