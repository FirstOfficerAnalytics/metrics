# My numbers aren't what I expected - Why?

To make confident business decisions, you must be confident that your numbers are right.

In principle, everything should work out-of-the-box.

In practice it's possible that:

1. You are using unsupported Stripe API features

1. The calculation rules differ from what you expected

1. Your business model requires customization to the calculations

1. Your numbers are right, but customers are doing something unexpected

1. There is a bug in the system

## You are using unsupported Stripe API features

Modified account balance causes most of the troubles - there's
no way to automatically recognize all intentions for changed balance.

FirstOfficer.io recognizes setup fees from balance, but not discounts or non-Stripe-payments.

You can read more in <%= link_to 'Best Practices for Using Stripe API', '/docs/stripe-api-best-practices.html' %>.

## The calculation rules differ from what you expected

MRR does not include non-subscription charges, or invoice items charged along with the subscription.

In financial analytics, no money = no customer.

Customers with 100% discounts are marked as lost.
Customers who missed a payment will be marked as lost (until the payment is recovered).
Customers who cancelled will not be marked as lost until the payments stop coming.

You can read more in <%= link_to 'Calculation Principles', '/docs/analytics_calculation_principles.html' %>.

## Your business model requires customization to the calculations

Most business models are recognized automatically, but sometimes customization is needed.
You might for example want to include non-subscription charges to MRR.
Or have created cent-plans for non-quantity usage and would want them removed from calculations.

## Your numbers are right, but customers are doing something unexpected

One common example is when annual subscriptions come up for the renewal the first time.
The Net Churn Rate raises as customers finally have a possibility to churn,
but as MRR Churn Rate is normalized, it continues to show true churn.

You don't need to know about these special cases yourself, just
 <%= partial 'contact-support' %> if you can't find a plausible explanation for change in numbers.

## There is a bug in the system

Although FirstOfficer.io provides reliable and accurate metrics for a large
number of customers already, it's always possible that your data triggers a bug.

If you can't find an explanation for the differences in this article,
please <%= partial 'contact-support' %>. Thanks to the drill-down feature,
it's easy to compare categorizations against customer lists from your old system.
