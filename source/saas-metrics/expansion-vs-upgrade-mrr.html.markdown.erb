# What's the Difference - Expansion and Upgrade MRR?

<%= image_tag 'expansion-and-contraction-mrr-difference.jpg', class: 'center'%>

No, Expansion MRR is NOT Upgrade MRR and Contraction MRR is NOT Downgrade MRR.

To make it even more complicated, there's
also [Committed MRR](http://support.firstofficer.io/saas-metrics/cmrr/)
and [Contracted MRR](http://support.firstofficer.io/saas-metrics/mrr/) and
those are different things too.

## What's the Difference Between Expansion and Upgrade?

When a customer moves from plan to another, there are two plans where the MRR changes:

1. The old plan, which loses the customer's revenue
2. The new plan, which wins the customer's revenue

The old plan suffers a Contraction - and the new plan gains an Expansion.

The sum of the Contraction and Expansion is the Upgrade... or Downgrade.

So when customer moves from plan to another there's always **both**
Expansion and Contraction. Together they form either an Upgrade or a Downgrade.

Whether a customer movement is an Upgrade or Downgrade [depends on what customer movements we want to see](http://blog.firstofficer.io/articles/monthly-to-annual-upgrades/).

If quantities are used, the [Upgrades and Downgrades are split to the plan change and volume change](http://support.firstofficer.io/docs/quantity_handling/).

## A Pitfall

The terminology around MRR is not controlled by GAAP or IRFS.
Other analytics apps may use the terms differently.
