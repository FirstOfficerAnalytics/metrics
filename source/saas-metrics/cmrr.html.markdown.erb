# Committed Monthly Recurring Revenue (CMRR)

<%= partial(:cheat_column_start, :locals => { :text => 'Description:'}) %>
Committed Monthly Recurring Revenue is an estimate
of how much recurring revenue will be collected next month.
It takes into account the current customer commitments and contracts.
<br><br>
The biggest difference to
<%= link_to 'Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)', '/saas-metrics/mrr.html' %> is that CMRR reduces the
recurring revenue from customers who have cancelled their subscription,
but the MRR loss will happen in next month.
<br><br>
It may also reduce revenue from customers who are expected to downgrade.
Likewise, it may contain expected future upgrade revenue.
<br><br>

CMRR = "how much recurring revenue do I expect next month, based on current contracts?"
<br><br>
MRR = "how much recurring revenue did I collect this month?"
<br><br>
<b>FirstOfficer.io does NOT calculate CMRR at the moment.</b>
