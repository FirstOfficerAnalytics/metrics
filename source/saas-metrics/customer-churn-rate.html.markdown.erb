When customer churns from an annual plan the formula gives you an annual churn rate.
You’ll need to normalize it to get a monthly churn rate. FirstOfficer does this for you.
<%= partial 'cheat_column_end' %>

<%= partial(:cheat_column_start, :locals => { :text => 'Variations:'}) %>
It varies when a customer is considered as ‘lost’. <br>
In FirstOfficer.io, customer is lost when s/he doesn’t renew a subscription. If refunds are given to annual subscription, customer is lost at the month when the full amount was refunded and subscription was canceled. If refunds are given to monthly subscription, customer is lost in the month when subscription revenue ceased.
