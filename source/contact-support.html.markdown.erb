      Hi, I'm Jaana, the founder and owner of FirstOfficer.io.
      <br><br>
      When you email to <a href="mailto:support@firstofficer.io">support@firstofficer.io</a>, it's usually me who gets back to you.
      You can expect a response in 24 hours, except on weekends.
      <br><br>
      I'm happy to help you and looking forward to hearing from you!
    </p>
