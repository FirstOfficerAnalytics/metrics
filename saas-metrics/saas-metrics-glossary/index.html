 However, when your main metric is MRR, we can use following formulas:
<br />
 When estimating future ARR for a single month: <code>MRR x 12</code>
 <br />
 When reporting past ARR in annual report: <code>Sum of MRRs from past 12 months</code>

    <p>

<b>Total value of committed contracts with customers</b><br />
When a customer commits to spend money with your company, that is a “booking”.<br />
However, if a contract period exceeds one year, it's common to book
just the value from the first year.<br /><br />
Bookings may be used e.g. to calculate provisions for sales personnel.
If you charge the annual and other long-term subscriptions up-front,
you usually don't need this metric.

Burn rate is a synonymous term for negative cash flow. It is used to calculate how fast a company uses its shareholder capital.
<br /><br />
People sometimes use burn rate also when
there are positive cash-flows. In that case what they
call "gross burn rate" is the normal burn rate and "net burn rate" is <code>Burn Rate - MRR</code>.

    <h3>Churn Rate</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-lg-9">
    <p>

<b>Percentage of customers who stop subscribing to a service</b><br />
This is the SaaS metric with most variations of them all.
<br /><br />
Churn rate can
be calculated for Customers/Accounts, Subscriptions, Users and MRR.
<br /><br />
In addition to that there are net and regular (non-net) churn rates.
The net churn rate is calculated from the whole customer base, while the
regular churn rate is calculated from customers who can actually churn.
<a href="/docs/how_to_use_different_churn_rates/">Different variations are used for different purposes</a>.
<br /><br />
On top of that, businesses may use their own
<a href="http://blog.firstofficer.io/articles/your-ltv-is-wrong-if/">custom definitions for active customers</a>.
This means that you must be careful when comparing your churn rate to others.
<br /><br />
Only non-SaaS businesses calculate Revenue Churn from non-normalized revenue and they use
different formulas, SaaSes use MRR Churn instead.
<br /><br />
FirstOfficer shows Net MRR Churn, Subscription Churn and MRR Churn.
If your customers each have just one subscription, Subscription Churn is the same as Customer/User Churn.

  It's also common to calculate intermediate conversion rates (Conversion Funnel): <br />

<a name="CLTV"></a>
<b>Customer Life-Time Value. Estimate of the projected total value of a customer.</b>
<br /><br />
"Value" originally meant "profit", but there are several
variations of this metric. For some reason everyone seems to be nowadays
calculating the revenue-based variation so that's what FirstOfficer offers too.
<br /><br />
However, it's strongly recommended that you convert your CLTV to
the profit-based form before using it.
<br /><br />
Revenue-based formula:<br />
<code> (1 / Customer Churn Rate) * ARPU </code><br />
<br />
Simplified profit-based formula: <br />
<code> ((1 / Customer Churn Rate) * ARPU ) * GPM</code><br />

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-lg-9">
    <p>

<a name="MRR"></a>
<b>Monthly Recurring Revenue. Revenue that's likely to continue in the next month</b>.<br />
There are several variations, like <a href="/saas-metrics/cmrr/">Committed MRR (CMRR)</a>
and Contracted MRR. FirstOfficer shows <a href="/saas-metrics/mrr/">Contracted MRR</a>.
<br /><br />
In addition to that, it's useful to split MRR to subcomponents:
<br />
<ul>
<li>New MRR - The MRR from new and returning customers</li>
<li>Lost or Churned MRR - The MRR lost due to leaving customers</li>
<li>Upgrade MRR - The MRR from plan upgrades</li>
<li>Downgrade MRR - The MRR from plan downgrades</li>
</ul>
Terms Expansion MRR and Contraction MRR are often used synonymously
with Upgrade and Downgrade MRR. If you are looking only at
 the top-level MRR, they mean the same thing.
<br /><br />
However, Expansion and Contraction MRR are used in following formula:
<br />
<code>New MRR + Expansion MRR - Contraction MRR - Lost MRR = MRR Growth</code>
<br /><br />
Unless a <a href="/saas-metrics/expansion-vs-upgrade-mrr/">different definition is used</a>,
the formula above stops working at plan level.
<br /><br />
It's also worth to notice that different businesses have different
definitions to what is considered Upgrade and Downgrade.
For example, when a customer moves from annual to monthly plan,
<a href="http://blog.firstofficer.io/articles/monthly-to-annual-upgrades/">is that an upgrade or downgrade?</a>
<br /><br />
MRR Growth is also called Net New MRR. <br />FirstOfficer discourages the use of Net New MRR and recommends using MRR Growth instead.

<b>Revenue that's highly likely to continue in the future</b><br />
Recurring revenue is booked at the rate that service is delivered.
Only the part of the revenue
that's expected to continue also in the next month is included.
<br /><br />
Booking revenue as it's earned is a standard practice in accrual-basis accounting,
but when we calculate MRR, we don't do official 'revenue recognition'
with its standardized rules, but something called 'normalization'.
We don't call it 'depreciation', because depreciation also
accounts for loss of value during time.
We don't call it 'amortization', because amortization is just
depreciation for intangible assets - like stocks.

In non-SaaS context, Quick Ratio measures company's ability to pay
its liabilities with its near cash or quick assets.

FirstOfficer discourages the use of SaaS Quick Ratio and offers Growth-to-New Ratio instead:<br />
<code>MRR Growth / (New MRR + Upgrade MRR)</code><br />
