<h1 id="mrr-calculation-principles-for-annual-subscription-refunds">MRR Calculation Principles for Annual Subscription Refunds</h1>

<p><em>We're publishing a time-integrity fix at Dec 2015. This article explains
how it changes refund calculations</em></p>

<p>To provide accurate data FirstOfficer uses double-entry bookings, automatic
cross-checking and error-recovery. Most importantly, we follow
strict accounting rules.</p>

<p>One of the most important rules is time-integrity:</p>

<div class="black-box">The results must be the same, no matter when the metrics are calculated</div>

<h2 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h2>

<p>Let's imagine that you'd cancel today and switch to a competitor analytics product.
When you'd come back three months later and have FirstOfficer re-import your data and
calculate metrics again, your old numbers would be the same than they were before you left.</p>

<p>Calculations must not depend on transient factors like Stripe hook events,
which may not be available every time the same calculation is made.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-firstofficer-break-this-rule">How did FirstOfficer break this rule?</h2>

<p>Until Dec 2015, FirstOfficer booked refunded losses based on whether or not the subscription was still active in Stripe.</p>

<p>Subscription existence in Stripe is transient information.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>Customer bought an annual subscription at Dec 2014.
In January 2015 they were refunded, but the Stripe subscription in was not cancelled.
Instead, the subscription was cancelled 5 months later in July.</p>

<p>When was this customer lost and with what MRR?</p>

<p>Below is how FirstOfficer would have booked this in 2 scenarios:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You were using FirstOfficer BEFORE the refund/cancellation in this example happened</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You started using FirstOfficer AFTER and metrics were reconstructed from old Stripe data</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../../images/FO_dec_15_time-integrity-fix.png" /></p>

<p>The loss got booked to a different month so the churn varied based on when the numbers were calculated.
Also the ARPU varied, as any active $0 MRR customers lower it.</p>

<p><strong>Why wasn't this customer lost in July?</strong></p>

<p>It's financial analytics so we book by the financial events - invoices, refunds, etc.
When possible, customer is marked as lost when revenue ceases.</p>

<p>The customer events like cancellations are important too, but that's the business of behavioural analytics.</p>

<h2 id="how-will-firstofficer-book-this-after-the-fix">How will FirstOfficer book this after the fix?</h2>

<p>FirstOfficer will now check for the subscription existence each month and
when it detects that a refunded subscription has been cancelled, it books the
loss using the AFTER scenario.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/FO_dec_15_time-integrity-fix_after.png" /></p>

<p>We will also look up for any past incidences and fix them.</p>

<h2 id="how-will-this-affect-my-numbers">How will this affect my numbers?</h2>

<p>The fix will move the losses due to refunds from the month when subscription was
cancelled to the month when the refund was given or the next payment failed.</p>

<p>So it'll shuffle your churn numbers a bit. If you had a significant amount of
annual subscription refunds, it may also affect your ARPU.</p>

<p>It will only affect the entries booked after you started using FirstOfficer, your
historical numbers have been booked like this already.</p>
