<h1 id="calculation-principles-for-prepaid-revenue">Calculation Principles for Prepaid Revenue</h1>

<p><em>Prepaid Revenue may also be called Prepaid MRR. 
Unearned Revenue and Deferred Revenue are related concepts in accrual-basis accounting.</em></p>

<p>This article explains how FirstOfficer calculates Prepaid Revenue.</p>

<div class="black-box">Prepaid Revenue is the total sum of all revenue you have collected from customers,
but haven't provided the service for yet.</div>

<h2 id="how-the-prepaid-revenue-is-calculated">How the Prepaid Revenue is calculated?</h2>

<p>Prepaid Revenue calculation follows MRR calculation principles. </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>A customer buys an annual subscription 15th Jan and pays $120.</p>

<p>We book $10 to January and $110 to Prepaid Revenue.</p>

<p>We assume that service gets delivered 1st day each month. When 1st of February arrives, $10 is booked to MRR and $100 remains in Prepaid Revenue. </p>

<p>Prepaid Revenue does not fluctuate with month length, like Deferred Revenue in accrual-basis accounting does.
Months with 28 days will carry just as much Prepaid Revenue as months with 31 days.  </p>

<h2 id="how-often-does-it-get-calculated">How often does it get calculated?</h2>

<p>Prepaid Revenue is updated every time your metrics are re-calculated. 
However, you'll see a large decrease in Prepaid Revenue 1st of each month as part of the previously Prepaid Revenue moves into MRR. </p>

<h2 id="how-do-cancellations-affect-prepaid-revenue">How do cancellations affect Prepaid Revenue?</h2>

<p>FirstOfficer tracks money, not intention. </p>

<p>Prepaid Revenue was already paid - so unless the customer requires a refund, cancellation does not reduce your Prepaid Revenue.   </p>

<h2 id="how-do-upgrades-and-downgrades-affect-prepaid-revenue">How do upgrades and downgrades affect Prepaid Revenue?</h2>

<p>In principle upgrades and downgrades are also just an intention until you charge the customer (prorate the subscription). </p>

<p>When the proration is made, Prepaid Revenue gets adjusted based on the changes. </p>

<p>There is a pitfall in charging the upgrades with Stripe and you can accidentally let customers use your service for free. Please see tip 1 in <a href="http://www.turbineroom.com/2016/stripe-charge-prorated-subscriptions-immediately/">Stripe: When should I charge prorated subscriptions immediately?</a>.</p>
