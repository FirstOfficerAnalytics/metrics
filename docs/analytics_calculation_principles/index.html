<h1 id="calculation-principles">Calculation Principles</h1>

<p>This article explains the principles that
FirstOfficer.io uses to calculate your metrics.</p>

<p>SaaS metrics aren't controlled by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
As a result, different apps may use different calculation principles.</p>

<p>If you have a questions about how your metrics are calculated and can't find
the answer here, please <a href="/contact-support/">contact support</a>
.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-included-in-mrr-and-revenue">What is included in MRR and Revenue?</h2>
<p>Taxes and Stripe fees are included in both
<a href="/saas-metrics/mrr/">Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)</a>
 and Revenue. Refunds and discounts are excluded.</p>

<p>MRR only includes revenue from subscriptions.
Any other charges invoiced with a subscription are excluded, as are all other single purchases.</p>

<p>FirstOfficer.io supports volume-based charging if you have implemented it using
 Stripe subscription's quantity field.</p>

<h2 id="customer-is-lost-when-a-subscription-isnt-renewed">Customer is lost when a subscription isn't renewed</h2>

<p>Customer is lost when the recurring revenue ceases.
For accurate financial analytics, customer is NOT lost on the
day he cancels his subscription.</p>

<p>If customer cancels and gets a refund, he is lost at the date when the refund is given. Otherwise he is lost at the date when he should pay again, but doesn't.</p>

<p>FirstOfficer.io does not currently offer
<a href="/saas-metrics/cmrr/">Committed Monthly Recurring Revenue (CMRR)</a>.
CMRR would book the MRR losses based on cancellation date, but it does not reflect the recurring revenue collected from customers during the month.</p>

<h2 id="churn-baselines">Churn baselines</h2>

<p>Net Churn is calculated using the previous month's total MRR as its base.</p>

<p>All other churn rates check that customer can actually be lost,
i.e. he has an active subscription that should be renewed.</p>

<p>New customers are excluded from all churn rates. The loss of new customer reduces New MRR.</p>

<h2 id="all-recurring-revenue-is-normalized-including-refunds-and-discounts">All recurring revenue is normalized, including refunds and discounts</h2>

<p>To offer most accurate picture of your finances, all transactions that affect MRR are
<a href="/saas-metrics/normalized-revenue/">normalized</a>.</p>

<p>The method is similar than revenue recognition in accrual accounting,
but as the target is to create comparable numbers different month lenghts are not adjusted for.</p>

<p>In plain english, a subscription of $120/year results in $10 MRR each
month - no matter how many days that month has.</p>

<p>Also refunds and discounts are normalized.
If you give a discount, the discount will be split evenly throughout the subscription period.
If you give a refund, the refunded amount will be split to the whole subscription period.
The only exception are the refunds that are given at cancellation time.</p>

<h2 id="historical-numbers-are-updated-when-necessary">Historical numbers are updated when necessary</h2>

<p>Because refunds are normalized, previous months' MRR may change when new refunds appear.
If you refund a customer today,
you gave back money that was paid in previous month - thus the
previous month's MRR need to be adjusted.</p>

<p>You can see the difference between refunds given and
refunds booked to MRR in Revenue view.</p>

<h2 id="prorations-are-normalized-to-keep-plan-and-upgrade-mrr-accurate">Prorations are normalized to keep plan and upgrade MRR accurate</h2>

<p>When customer upgrades or downgrades his subscription and prorations are used,
FirstOfficer.io normalizes the prorations to make sure that individual plans' MRR
and upgrade/downgrade MRR stay accurate.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>A customer is now on plan A, $20/month and upgrades to plan B, $40/month.
When he changes the plan mid-month, the proration refunds $10 to plan A
and charges $20 for plan B.</p>

<p>If these amounts would be booked as they are, plan A would have $10 of MRR and plan B would have $20 of MRR.
Total MRR would change from $20 to $30 and this upgrade would be valued at $10 of MRR, which would be wrong.</p>

<p>FirstOfficer.io will book $0 for plan A and $40 for plan B.
This way it can accurately calculate that this upgrade caused $20 increase in MRR.</p>
